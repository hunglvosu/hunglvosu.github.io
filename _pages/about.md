I am interested in Theoretical Computer Science in general and Graph Algorithms in particular. I am a member of  [Umass Theory Group](https://www.cics.umass.edu/research/area/theoretical-computer-science)

**Bio (in 3rd person for talks):** Hung Le has been an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Umass Amherst since 2020. He was a <a href = "http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/postdoctoral/postdoctoral-fellows#pdf-2018">PIMS</a> postdoc at the University of Victoria with <a href ="http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~val/">Valerie King</a> and a PhD student at Oregon State University, advised by <a href="http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/glencora/">Cora Borradaile</a>. He got his undergraduate degree from <a href="https://hust.edu.vn/en/">Hanoi University of Science and Technology</a>, Vietnam. 

My research has been generously supported by an NSF small grant  ([CCF-2121952](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2121952)), an NSF CAREER Award ([CCF-2237288](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2237288)) and a Google Research Scholar Award.

My technical blog [Rambling on Graphs](https://minorfree.github.io) is up. <br>


<br> Check out our FOCS 2022 workshop "[Advances on Metric Embeddings](https://hackmd.io/@3S70qBUwTR6_CErLY2dm4A/SJfp46KGi)" I co-organize with [Arnold Filtser](https://arnold.filtser.com).

## News

I will be updating both good news, bad news and all kinds of news. 

 - **[June 2025]** Our paper "Approximate Light Spanners in Planar Graphs" was uploaded to [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24825).   

 - **[May 2025]** Gave a talk a theory seminar of Northeastern on "Designing Graph Algorithms with VC Dimension".
 
 - **[April 2025]** Our paper "Light Tree Covers, Routing, and Path-Reporting Oracles via Spanning Tree Covers in Doubling Graphs" was uploaded to [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22669).

 - **[February 2025]** PC member of [WADS  25](https://cccg-wads-2025.eecs.yorku.ca/WADS%202025.html). 

 - **[February 2025]** Two papers were accepted at [STOC  25](https://acm-stoc.org/stoc2025/). Congrats [An](https://anla-cs.github.io) and [Cuong](https://thanvietcuong.github.io) for their 1st STOC papers! 
 
 - **[November 2024]** My application for [Lilly Fellowship](https://www.umass.edu/ctl/lilly-fellowship-teaching-excellence) was eliminated in the departmental round. 
 
 - **[November 2024]** Our paper "Learning Representations for Hierarchies with Minimal Support" was uploaded to [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HFS800reZK).

 - **[November 2024]** Our paper "Embedding Planar Graphs into Graphs of Treewidth $O(\log^3n)$" was uploaded to [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00216).
 
 - **[October 2024]** Two papers were accepted at [SODA 25](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda25). 
 
- **[September 2024]** Our paper "Learning Representations for Hierarchies with Minimal Support" was accepted at [NeurIPS 24](https://nips.cc/virtual/2024/papers.html?filter=titles). The major effort is due to student Benjamin Rozonoyer. This paper has a very interesting theoretical problem that I had never seen before (and I only contributed to this part of the paper.).

 - **[September 2024]** Our paper "Towards Instance-Optimal Euclidean Spanners" was uploaded to [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08227).
