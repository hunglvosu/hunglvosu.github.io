I am interested in Theoretical Computer Science in general and Graph Algorithms in particular. I am associated with [Umass Theory Group](https://www.cics.umass.edu/research/area/theoretical-computer-science). Before coming to Umass, I was a <a href = "http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/postdoctoral/postdoctoral-fellows#pdf-2018">PIMS</a> postdoc at the Compter Science Department, University of Victoria, hosted by <a href = "http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~val/">Valerie King</a>.  I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Oregon State University. I am fortunate enough to have <a href="http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/glencora/">Cora Borradaile</a> as my advisor. Long time ago, I got a B.S. degree in Computer Science (honors program) from <a href="http://en.hust.edu.vn/home">Hanoi University of Science and Technology</a>. 

<br> My technical blog [Rambling on Graphs](https://minorfree.github.io) is up. <br>


<br> Check out our FOCS 2022 workshop "[Advances on Metric Embeddings](https://hackmd.io/@3S70qBUwTR6_CErLY2dm4A/SJfp46KGi)" I co-organize with [Arnold Filtser](https://arnold.filtser.com).
