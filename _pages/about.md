I am an Associate ~~Assistant~~ Professor of Computer Science at UMass Amherst. I am interested in Theoretical Computer Science in general and Graph Algorithms in particular. I am a member of  [Umass Theory Group](https://www.cics.umass.edu/research/area/theoretical-computer-science)

**Bio (in 3rd person for talks):** Hung Le has been a faculty member at Umass Amherst since 2020. He was a <a href = "http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/postdoctoral/postdoctoral-fellows#pdf-2018">PIMS</a> postdoc at the University of Victoria with <a href ="http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~val/">Valerie King</a> and a PhD student at Oregon State University, advised by <a href="http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/glencora/">Cora Borradaile</a>. He got his undergraduate degree from <a href="https://hust.edu.vn/en/">Hanoi University of Science and Technology</a>, Vietnam. 

My research has been generously supported by two NSF small grants  ([CCF-2517033](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2517033&HistoricalAwards=false) and [CCF-2121952](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2121952)), an NSF CAREER Award ([CCF-2237288](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2237288)) and a Google Research Scholar Award.

My technical blog [Rambling on Graphs](https://minorfree.github.io) is up. <br>


<br> Check out our FOCS 2022 workshop "[Advances on Metric Embeddings](https://hackmd.io/@3S70qBUwTR6_CErLY2dm4A/SJfp46KGi)" I co-organize with [Arnold Filtser](https://arnold.filtser.com).
