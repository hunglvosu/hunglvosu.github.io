I am interested in Theoretical Computer Science in general and Graph Algorithms in particular. I am associated with [Umass Theory Group](https://www.cics.umass.edu/research/area/theoretical-computer-science). Before coming to Umass, I was a <a href = "http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/postdoctoral/postdoctoral-fellows#pdf-2018">PIMS</a> postdoc at the Compter Science Department, University of Victoria, hosted by <a href = "http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~val/">Valerie King</a>.  I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Oregon State University. I am fortunate enough to have <a href="http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/glencora/">Cora Borradaile</a> as my advisor. Long time ago, I got a B.S. degree in Computer Science (honors program) from <a href="http://en.hust.edu.vn/home">Hanoi University of Science and Technology</a>.  <br>
<br> My research has been generously supported by an NSF small grant  ([CCF-2121952](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2121952)), an NSF CAREER Award ([CCF-2237288](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2237288)) and a Google Research Scholar Award.

<br> My technical blog [Rambling on Graphs](https://minorfree.github.io) is up. <br>


<br> Check out our FOCS 2022 workshop "[Advances on Metric Embeddings](https://hackmd.io/@3S70qBUwTR6_CErLY2dm4A/SJfp46KGi)" I co-organize with [Arnold Filtser](https://arnold.filtser.com).
<br>

**Note: I am NOT looking for a new PhD student this cycle.** I already have more PhD students than I could advise. Check out [other theory faculty](https://theory.cs.umass.edu) at UMass.<br>

## News

I will be updating both good news, bad news and all kinds of news. 

 - **[November 2024]** My application for [Lilly Fellowship](https://www.umass.edu/ctl/lilly-fellowship-teaching-excellence) was eliminated in the departmental round. 
 
 - **[November 2024]** Our paper "Learning Representations for Hierarchies with Minimal Support" was uploaded to [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HFS800reZK).

 - **[November 2024]** Our paper "Embedding Planar Graphs into Graphs of Treewidth $O(\log^3n)$" was uploaded to [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00216).
 
 - **[October 2024]** Two papers were accepted at [SODA 25](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda25). 
 
- **[September 2024]** Our paper "Learning Representations for Hierarchies with Minimal Support" was accepted at [NeurIPS 24](https://nips.cc/virtual/2024/papers.html?filter=titles). The major effort is due to student Benjamin Rozonoyer. This paper has a very interesting theoretical problem that I had never seen before (and I only contributed to this part of the paper.).

 - **[September 2024]** Our paper "Towards Instance-Optimal Euclidean Spanners" was uploaded to [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08227).
 
 - **[August 2024]** Super stoked about a paper with my student [An La](https://anla-cs.github.io) who came up with all major ideas in this paper: "Dynamic Locality Sensitive Orderings in Doubling Metrics" on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14617).
  
 - **[August 2024]** Paper with my student [An La](https://anla-cs.github.io) "New Weighted Additive Spanners" was uploaded to [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14638).
 
 - **[August 2024]** Our paper "Optimal Padded Decomposition For Bounded Treewidth Graphs" was uploaded to [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12230).
 
 - **[June 2024]** Our Dagstuhl worskhop proposal (with [Sujoy Bhore](https://sites.google.com/view/homepage-of-sujoy-bhore/home), [Jie Gao](https://sites.rutgers.edu/jie-gao/about/), and [Csaba D. TÃ³th](http://csabatoth.org)) was accepted. More info coming soon!

 - **[June 2024]** Two papers were rejected from [FOCS 24](https://focs.computer.org/2024/), and one paper got accepted to FOCS 24.
